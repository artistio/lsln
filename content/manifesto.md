<p class="post-content">Before continuing to read the rest of this manifesto, please pause. Look around to every corner of your house, inside every drawer, and especially into the storage room. Look at each item carefully, and try to answer the following questions: </p>
<ul class="post-content">
  <li>When did you buy the item?</li>
  <li>Why did you buy that item in the first place?</li>
  <li>When did the last time you used that item?</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-content">For most of the items, my guess is that you don't even remember of having them, let alone remembering when you bought them, or why.</p>
<p class="post-content">In the era of cheap goods from China and online shopping, it is become easier for us to buy things that we don’t need. The reasons for most of the time are one or more of the followings: it was sold at a discount, just in case we need it someday, special price when bought in bulk, helping a friend, shopping therapy. We probably look at the item once or twice, probably use it once or twice, and then it goes into the drawer, storage, or sometime even to our bag, without we even noticing.</p>
<p class="post-content">Believe it or not, this kind of behavior of hoarding stuff is also linked to the state of our mind. Studies showed that those who are hoarding and cluttering are likely to have unfocused mind, often under high amount of stress.</p>
<p class="post-content">Obviously, the reverse will also work. If you feel stressed, lack of control, and have unfocused mind, simplifying your life will help to improve that. Decluttering will help you to start simplifying your life. The same studies showed that decluttering your home is the first step towards decluttering your mind, and reduce stress. Decluttering your home is a start to building a habit to declutter your mind, and eventually your life.</p>
<p class="post-content">So, while you are looking at your drawer, and storage room, and answer the questions above, lets start to take action to declutter your life:</p>
<ul class="post-content">
  <li>Do I really need that item today, or in near future (1 week to 1 month)?</li>
  <li>If the answer is no, is there anyone who possibly need it, and can make use of the item better? If the answer is yes, then donate it.</li>
  <li>If the answer is no, then it is time to dispose the item. Don’t box and categorize it. Dispose it. No buts, no ifs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="post-content">Finally, the next time before you clicked the buy button, or check out at the cashier, ask the following question to yourself: Do I really need the item, or do I buy it because of other reasons?</p>
<h2 id="lovenature" class="post-title">Love Nature</h2>
<p class="post-quote">“Tak kenal maka tak sayang (doesn’t know hence doesn’t care)” - Indonesian Proverb</p>
<p class="post-content">Why we need to live in alignment with nature? With advancement in technology, it seems that we can live and hack the environment for us to have better live, regardless of the environment. Is global warming true? No worries, we just turn on the air conditioner. Food scarcity? The supermarkets are still full of food. Deforestation? Reduction in farming land? Well, we need those lands for our infrastructures, for our roads, and houses.</p>
<p class="post-content">The fact is, with the current state of affair, with where the nature is, and where our state of technology is, we can still live. But living is different from prospering. And in order to prosper, one need to align with nature.</p>
<p class="post-content">Let's look at our source of energy, our food. For a moment, it seems that we have options to buy packaged food that come from factory, instead of nature. They taste good, and filling. Those foods might keep us alive, but it doesn’t contain necessary nutrition to for us to thrive. That nutrition has been replaced with flavoring, seasoning and preservatives that does no good to our health. </p>
<p class="post-content">We are in agreement that the most beneficial food for us to thrive are those that come from nature, with minimum chemical addition and processing. Unfortunately, the soil where our food grow determines the nutritional value of the food itself. The minerals in our soil is so much depleted that nutritional value in our food is much less than same food decades ago. </p>
<p class="post-content">So, what can we do? We can’t love something that we barely know. So, the first step is to get outside and be in nature. </p>
<p class="post-content">There are reasons why just being outside makes you feel better. Exposure to sunlight triggers hormone that improves mood and hormone. Same thing happened when one is surrounded by green trees, or being at the beach, or mountain. Even though you don’t live near a beach or mountain, just being outside helps to improve your mood. </p>
<p class="post-content">Then, the next step is to improve the nature, starting for those immediately around us.  </p>
<ul class="post-content">
  <li>Plant trees at your home. If you don’t have plot of land to plant the trees, plant them in a pot.</li>
  <li>Reduce the use of one time use product, especially those that is not biodegradable. Bring your own mug instead of using paper cup next time you buy coffee. Bring water bottle and refill instead of buying mineral water in a one-time use bottle. Bring your own shopping bag instead of using plastic bag next time you go to supermarket.</li>
  <li>Reuse and recycle old stuff. Print wrong document on one side of paper? Reuse the same paper next time you print a draft document. Reuse plastic container as pot to grow plant. At a more sophisticated level is to reuse old glass bottle as drinking flask.</li>
</ul>
